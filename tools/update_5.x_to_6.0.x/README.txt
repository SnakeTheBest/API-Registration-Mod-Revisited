This folder contains the files needed to update EVE API from version 5.3 to 6.0.x (since 6.1.0 and up use a newer version of phpBB).

A guide on how to update can be found here; https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&m=1555109#post1555109

Please note that the guide speaks of a "Clean"-folder inside the package.
This "Clean"-folder has been removed, and all the files within have been moved to this folder.
So in other words, instead of step 3 (and 4), you can just upload all the files (and folders) of this folder to the root of your forum instead.
